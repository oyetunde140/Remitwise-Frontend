# RemitWise Frontend

Frontend application for the RemitWise remittance and financial planning platform.

> **New contributors:** start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch conventions, verified test commands, and PR expectations, then read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for a full route and layer map, and [docs/infrastructure.md](docs/infrastructure.md) for request gateway, logging, and runtime layers. For data fetching and caching patterns, see [docs/CACHE_STRATEGY.md](docs/CACHE_STRATEGY.md). For SSR vs. client-only patterns, see [docs/SSR_PATTERNS.md](docs/SSR_PATTERNS.md).

## Overview

This is a Next.js-based frontend skeleton that provides the UI structure for all RemitWise features. The application is built with:

- [Prisma data model and durability boundary](./docs/data-model.md)
- [Elevation and shadow guidance](./docs/ELEVATION.md)
- [Period lifecycle and state machine](./docs/PERIOD_LIFECYCLE.md)
- [Internal jargon glossary (contributors)](./docs/GLOSSARY.md)
- [Hydration mismatch patterns and fixes](./docs/HYDRATION_MISMATCH.md)

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Icon library — see [docs/ICON_SYSTEM.md](docs/ICON_SYSTEM.md) for usage, sizing, and adding custom icons

## Features (Placeholders)

The frontend includes placeholder pages and components for:

### Shared Components

- **AddressDisplay**: A component for displaying long strings like Stellar addresses, featuring truncation, a copy-to-clipboard button, and a tooltip showing the full address on hover.
- **Global Search**: The `/search?q=...` route surfaces matching invoice, address, and settings results from the same search vocabulary used in the command palette.

1. **Dashboard** - Overview of remittances, savings, bills, and insurance
2. **Send Money** - Remittance sending interface with automatic split preview
3. **Smart Money Split** - Configuration for automatic allocation
4. **Savings Goals** - Goal-based savings tracking and management
5. **Bill Payments** - Bill tracking, scheduling, and payment
6. **Micro-Insurance** - Policy management and premium payments
7. **Family Wallets** - Family member management with roles and spending limits

## Loading States

Dashboard, Bills, and Insights now use route-level skeleton screens built from `components/ui/Skeleton.tsx` so primary panels load with stable layout blocks instead of ad-hoc spinners. For detailed guidelines and implementation patterns on all UI states (Default, Error, Disabled, and Loading), see [docs/component-states.md](docs/component-states.md).

## Performance Budgets

Every page route has a per-route load-time budget based on its user impact tier. These budgets are enforced in CI via Lighthouse E2E tests and monitored in production through structured request logs. For the full route-to-budget map, measurement approach, and how to add budgets for new routes, see [docs/LOAD_TIME_BUDGETS.md](docs/LOAD_TIME_BUDGETS.md).

## Sentry

Sentry is wired through the client, server, and edge config files with separate environment variables for each runtime:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is used by the browser bundle.
- `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_RELEASE` are used on the server and edge runtimes.
- `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, and `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` are required for source map uploads in CI.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` drives sampling behavior, with higher collection in development and lower rates in production.
- The Sentry tunnel route is `/monitoring`, which keeps requests working through ad blockers.

PII scrubbing is applied before events leave the app:

- Client events scrub Stellar public keys and amount strings.
- Server events use the same scrubbing plus `iron-session` token redaction.
- Edge events stay minimal and do not attach replay or extra scrubbing.

Keep the auth token out of the repo and store it only in CI secrets.

For more details on tracking, cookies, and telemetry configuration, see the [Tracking and Opt-Out Guide](docs/tracking-and-opt-out.md).

## Getting Started

### Environment Configuration

The application requires connection to a Soroban RPC node.

- **Testnet:** `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` (Passphrase: `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`)
- **Mainnet:** `https://soroban-rpc.stellar.org` (Passphrase: `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015`)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup Database
# 1. Ensure you have `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"`
# Note: For serverless environments (like Vercel), connection pooling limits (default min 1, max 10)
# and timeouts (5s) are automatically configured on the Prisma DB client.
# 2. Run initial Prisma migration
npx prisma migrate dev

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Mock Backend

Run the local mock backend with one command:

```bash
npm run mock:backend
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:4010` by default. Set `MOCK_BACKEND_PORT`
to use a different port. The command is idempotent and keeps all data in memory,
so stopping and restarting it does not create or migrate local state.

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/dashboard`
- `GET /api/remittance/quote?amountMinor=10000&currency=USD&toCurrency=NGN`

Mock money values are returned as integer minor units, for example
`amountMinor`, `feeMinor`, and `receiveAmountMinor`.

### Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
npm run generate:types # Generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI spec

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Testing Toolchain

This project uses a multi-tool testing strategy. Note that **Jest is not used** in this repository.

#### Testing Frameworks Mapping

- **Node.js Native Test Runner (`node:test`)**
  - Used for: `.cjs` files
  - Commands: `npm run test:unit:node`, `npm run test:integration`

- **Vitest**
  - Used for: `.ts` / `.tsx` files (Unit & component testing)
  - Commands: `npm run test:unit:vitest`, `npm run test:coverage`

- **Playwright**
  - Used for: End-to-End (E2E) testing
  - Command: `npm run test:e2e`

- **Property Tests**
  - Used for: Property-based testing
  - Command: `npm run test:property`

- **Image Alt Attribute Accessibility Check**
  - Used for: Build-time enforcement ensuring no `<img>` or `<Image />` tag lacks an `alt` attribute
  - Command: `npm run check:img-alt` (wired into `npm run lint` and `npm run prebuild`)

> **Full guide:** see [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) for the complete multi-runner
> reference — when to use Vitest vs. node:test vs. Playwright, a map of every
> `package.json` test script, the `tests/` layout, coverage and gate expectations, and a
> "how to add a test" recipe per runner.

#### Running Tests

It is important to understand the difference between `npm run test` and `npm run test:coverage`:

- `npm run test` (Limited): Runs a standard fast suite of tests (typically limited to unit tests).
- `npm run test:coverage` (Broad): Uses Vitest to run the broader test suite (including all `.test.ts` files) and generates a comprehensive code coverage report. Contributors should generally use this to ensure full coverage.

```bash
# Run standard unit tests
npm test

# Run full Vitest suite with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

#### Unit Tests

- **Location**: `tests/unit/` and `tests/session/`
- **Command**: `npm run test:unit` (runs both Node and Vitest)

#### Integration Tests

- **Location**: `tests/integration/`
- **Command**: `npm run test:integration`
- **Framework**: `node:test` + direct route handler calls
- **Database**: In-memory SQLite (fast, isolated)
- **Speed**: Sub-10 second execution

**What's Tested:**

- `GET /api/health` - Health check (no auth required)
- `POST /api/auth/nonce` - Nonce generation
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authentication with signature
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Session cleanup
- `GET /api/split` - Protected route with auth enforcement
- Error handling (400, 401, 404 responses)

**How They Work:**
Integration tests import route handlers directly and call them as functions with mock requests. No server startup overhead, fully deterministic.

**Documentation**: See [docs/TESTING_INTEGRATION.md](docs/TESTING_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed guide on writing and running integration tests.

#### CI Integration

Tests run on GitHub Actions for every push/PR to `main` and `dev`. The pipeline fails if any tests fail.

### Authentication & Signature Verification

RemitWise implements a nonce-based challenge-response authentication mechanism to verify genuine wallet ownership over the Stellar network.

**Message Format and Verification Steps:**

1. **Request Nonce:** The frontend calls `GET /api/auth/nonce?address=<STELLAR_PUBLIC_KEY>` to receive a securely generated random 32-byte hex string (nonce). This nonce is temporarily cached on the server.
2. **Sign Nonce:** The client wallet (e.g., Freighter) is prompted to sign the raw nonce. The message to be signed is the byte representation of the hex nonce.
3. **Submit Signature:** The client submits `{"address": "...", "signature": "..."}` to `POST /api/auth/login`. The signature should be base64-encoded.
4. **Verification:** The backend converts the nonce to a Buffer and verifies the base64 signature against the supplied public address using `@stellar/stellar-sdk` (`Keypair.fromPublicKey(address).verify(nonceBuffer, signatureBuffer)`). Invalid signatures or missing/expired nonces will receive a `401 Unauthorized`.

### End-to-End Testing

To run the Playwright end-to-end tests for authentication and protected routes:

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test:e2e
```

For validating responsive breakpoints and layouts across different viewports, see the [Responsive Testing Guide](docs/RESPONSIVE_TESTING.md).

The full keyboard shortcut reference lives at [docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md](docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md) — every registered shortcut, where it's handled, and how to add or change one. End users can open the printable cheat sheet at [`/shortcuts`](/shortcuts) (also linked from the `?` help modal).

## API Routes

See [API Routes Documentation](./docs/API_ROUTES.md) for details on authentication and available endpoints.

Every route handler under `app/api/` is composed from a small set of reusable decorators (`withAuth`, `validatedRoute`, `withApiErrorHandler`). See [docs/api-route-decorators.md](./docs/api-route-decorators.md) for what each one does and when to use it.

For authenticated browser-side requests, use the shared client API layer documented in [docs/client-api.md](docs/client-api.md). That guide covers when to use `apiClient` instead of raw `fetch`, the `401 -> refresh -> retry once` flow, session-expiry UI surfacing, and logout behavior.

For server-side and third-party requests that need automatic abort on deadline, use the `fetchWithTimeout` wrapper documented in [docs/fetch-timeout.md](docs/fetch-timeout.md). Each endpoint declares its timeout in `lib/config/fetch-timeouts.ts`; the wrapper aborts and throws a `TimeoutError` if the deadline is exceeded. `apiClient` uses the same design for browser requests.

### Transaction Export

Both the standalone **Transactions** page (`/transactions`) and the dashboard
**Transaction History** page (`/dashboard/transaction-history`) support
exporting the currently filtered transaction list as **CSV** or **JSON**.
Click the Export button to open a format picker (CSV for spreadsheets, JSON
for programmatic consumption). Exports are capped at **10,000 rows** and
include the filter context (date range) in the download filename.

Route-level page titles now use a shared deep-link heading pattern. Use the shared heading primitive with a stable route-specific id whenever you add or update a primary page title. See [docs/page-heading-deeplinks.md](docs/page-heading-deeplinks.md).

The `/transactions` view only ever lists user-initiated interactions (sends, splits, bill payments, etc.) and its type filter is how a reader narrows that list. See [docs/transactions-user-interaction-filter.md](docs/transactions-user-interaction-filter.md) for the model and what to update if a system-generated entry type is ever added.

## Per-Route SEO Metadata (`useSeo`)

Each client-side route can define its own `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` using the `useSeo` hook.

### Quick Start

```tsx
"use client";

import { useSeo } from "@/lib/hooks/useSeo";

export default function MyPage() {
  useSeo({
    title: "My Page | RemitWise",
    description: "A short description of what this page does.",
  });

  return <main>{/* page content */}</main>;
}
```

### Default Metadata

Defaults are defined in [`lib/config/seo.ts`](./lib/config/seo.ts):

```ts
export const DEFAULT_SEO = {
  title: "RemitWise - Smart Remittance & Financial Planning",
  description:
    "A remittance app that helps families save, plan, and protect — not just send money.",
};
```

If `title` or `description` is omitted from `useSeo(...)`, the corresponding default is used automatically.

### Behaviour

| Scenario                                         | Result                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `useSeo({ title, description })`                 | Sets both title and description               |
| `useSeo({ title })`                              | Sets title; uses `DEFAULT_SEO.description`    |
| `useSeo()`                                       | Uses both defaults                            |
| Component unmounts                               | Reverts to previous route's SEO (stack-based) |
| Layout already has a `<meta name="description">` | Reuses it — no duplicates created             |

### Server Components

Async Server Components (e.g. dynamic `[tutorialId]` routes) use Next.js's built-in [`generateMetadata`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) export instead:

```ts
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const { id } = await params;
  return { title: `${id} | RemitWise`, description: "..." };
}
```

The `api/docs/page.tsx` route uses a static `export const metadata` export for the same reason.

### Tests

Unit tests live in [`tests/unit/hooks/useSeo.test.tsx`](./tests/unit/hooks/useSeo.test.tsx) and cover:

- Title updates correctly
- Description updates correctly
- Navigation updates metadata
- Default metadata is used when values are omitted
- No duplicate `<meta>` tags are created
- Stack-based cleanup on unmount

**Quick Reference:**

- Public routes: `/api/health`, `/api/auth/*`
- Protected routes: `/api/user/*`, `/api/split`, `/api/goals`, `/api/bills`, `/api/insurance`, `/api/family`, `/api/send`

## Integration Requirements

### Stellar SDK Integration

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Integrate Freighter wallet or similar
   - Connect to Stellar network (testnet/mainnet)
   - Handle account authentication

2. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Connect to deployed Soroban contracts
   - Implement contract function calls
   - Handle transaction signing and submission

3. **Anchor Platform Integration**
   - Integrate with anchor platform APIs for fiat on/off-ramps
   - Handle deposit/withdrawal flows
   - Process exchange rate quotes
   - **Environment Setup:** Set `ANCHOR_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file (see `.env.example`).
   - **Frontend API Endpoints:**
     - `GET /api/anchor/rates` (cached exchange rates)
     - `POST /api/anchor/deposit` (authenticated; starts fiat -> USDC flow)
     - `POST /api/anchor/withdraw` (authenticated; starts USDC -> fiat flow)
   - Deposit/withdraw returns `501 Not Implemented` when anchor integration is not configured.

4. **Transaction Tracking**
   - Display on-chain transaction history
   - Show transaction status and confirmations
   - Implement real-time updates

### Key Integration Points

- **Send Money Page**: Connect to Stellar SDK for transaction creation and signing
- **Split Configuration**: Call `remittance_split` contract to initialize/update split
- **Savings Goals**: Integrate with `savings_goals` contract for goal management
- **Bills**: Connect to `bill_payments` contract for bill tracking
- **Insurance**: Integrate with `insurance` contract for policy management
- **Family Wallets**: Connect to `family_wallet` contract for member management

## Backend / API

### Overview

This Next.js application uses API routes to handle backend functionality. API routes are located in the `app/api/` directory and follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions.

**Key API Routes:**

- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints (wallet connect, nonce generation, signature verification)
- `/api/transactions/*` - Transaction history and status
- `/api/contracts/*` - Soroban smart contract interactions
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint

All API routes are serverless functions deployed alongside the frontend.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Stellar Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet  # or 'mainnet'
SOROBAN_NETWORK=testnet              # server-side network selector: testnet|mainnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org

# Contract IDs (server-side network resolution)
# Option A: set per-network vars
REMITTANCE_SPLIT_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET=

ANCHOR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Admin / internal APIs
ADMIN_SECRET=

# In-process background shutdown timeout
SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
```

See `.env.example` for a complete list of configuration options.

### API Middleware Configuration

The middleware (`middleware.ts`) applies CORS headers, security headers, and request validation to all `/api` routes.

#### CORS Policy

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow requests from the frontend application:

- **Allowed Origins**: Requests from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` are allowed (or same-origin)
- **Allowed Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
- **Allowed Headers**: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Request-ID, X-Requested-With
- **Credentials**: Allowed for same-origin requests
- **Preflight Handling**: OPTIONS requests return 204 No Content with appropriate CORS headers

**Configuration:**

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Frontend URL for CORS policy (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Example: Testing CORS**

```bash
# Test CORS headers on a preflight request
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3000/api/health \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST"

# Response includes:
# Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
# Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
# Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Request-ID, X-Requested-With
```

#### Security Headers

All API responses include the following security headers to protect against common vulnerabilities:

| Header                   | Value           | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff`       | Prevents MIME-type sniffing attacks            |
| `X-Frame-Options`        | `DENY`          | Prevents clickjacking attacks                  |
| `X-XSS-Protection`       | `1; mode=block` | Legacy XSS protection (modern browsers ignore) |
| `Vary`                   | `Origin`        | Instructs caches to vary response by origin    |

These headers are applied automatically to all `/api` responses and do not require configuration.

#### Request Body Size Limit

POST, PUT, and PATCH requests are validated for size to prevent oversized payloads:

- **Default Limit**: 1MB (1,048,576 bytes)
- **Validation**: Checks `Content-Length` header first, falls back to reading body if header missing
- **Response**: 413 Payload Too Large with JSON error details if exceeded

**Configuration:**

```bash
# Maximum request body size in bytes (default 1MB)
API_MAX_BODY_SIZE=1048576
```

**Example: Testing Body Size Validation**

```bash
# Valid request (under 1MB)
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":"test"}'
# Response: 200 OK or appropriate handler response

# Oversized request (over 1MB)
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=2 2>/dev/null | base64)"
# Response: 413 Payload Too Large
# {"error": "Payload Too Large", "message": "Request body exceeds maximum size of 1048576 bytes."}
```

#### Middleware Flow

The middleware processes requests in the following order:

1. **Whitelist Checks** - Health check and Playwright test requests bypass all middleware
2. **CORS & Security Headers** - Applied to all responses before processing
3. **Preflight Handling** - OPTIONS requests return 204 No Content
4. **Body Size Validation** - POST/PUT/PATCH requests checked against size limit
5. **Rate Limiting** - Applied after headers/validation (does not block preflight)
6. **Response** - Headers added to response, request proceeds to handler

This order ensures OPTIONS preflight requests complete successfully while maintaining security and rate limiting enforcement.

### Running the Backend

The backend API routes run automatically with the Next.js development server:

```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api/*`

### Authentication Flow

RemitWise uses wallet-based authentication with the following flow:

1. **Wallet Connect**: User connects their Stellar wallet (Freighter, Albedo, etc.)
   - Frontend detects wallet extension
   - User authorizes connection
   - Public key is retrieved

2. **Nonce Generation**:
   - Client requests nonce from `/api/auth/nonce`
   - Server generates unique nonce and stores temporarily
   - Nonce returned to client

3. **Signature Verification**:
   - Client signs nonce with wallet private key
   - Signed message sent to `/api/auth/verify`
   - Server verifies signature matches public key
   - If valid, session token is created

4. **Session Management**:
   - JWT token stored in HTTP-only cookie
   - Token includes user's public key and expiration
   - Subsequent requests include token for authentication
   - Token validated on protected API routes

**Protected Routes**: All `/api/transactions/*`, `/api/contracts/*` endpoints require valid session.

### Contract IDs and Deployment

The application interacts with the following Soroban smart contracts on Stellar:

| Contract         | Purpose                       | Preferred Environment Variable                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Remittance Split | Automatic money allocation    | `REMITTANCE_SPLIT_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET` |
| Savings Goals    | Goal-based savings management | `SAVINGS_GOALS_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET`    |
| Bill Payments    | Bill tracking and payments    | `BILL_PAYMENTS_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET`    |
| Insurance        | Micro-insurance policies      | `INSURANCE_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET`        |
| Family Wallet    | Family member management      | `FAMILY_WALLET_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET`    |

**Deployment Notes:**

- Contracts must be deployed to Stellar testnet/mainnet before use
- Set `SOROBAN_NETWORK=testnet|mainnet` to choose active deployment
- Provide contract IDs per network or via `CONTRACT_IDS_JSON`
- `/api/health` includes current network and resolved contract IDs outside production (or when `HEALTH_INCLUDE_CONTRACT_IDS=true`)
- Contract ABIs are included in `lib/contracts/` directory

### Health and Monitoring

**Health Check Endpoint**: `GET /api/health`

Returns system status and connectivity:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-02-24T10:30:00Z",
  "services": {
    "stellar": "connected",
    "contracts": "available",
    "database": "connected"
  },
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

**Monitoring Recommendations:**

- Set up uptime monitoring for `/api/health`
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Track Stellar network connectivity
- Log contract interaction failures
- Set alerts for authentication failures

### Testing

**Unit Tests**

Test individual API route handlers and utility functions:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

Unit tests are located alongside source files with `.test.ts` extension.

**Integration Tests**

Test complete API flows including authentication and contract interactions:

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Test specific API route
npm run test:integration -- auth
```

Integration tests are in the `__tests__/integration/` directory.

**Testing Checklist:**

- ✓ Authentication flow (nonce → sign → verify)
- ✓ Contract interactions (all 5 contracts)
- ✓ Error handling and validation
- ✓ Rate limiting
- ✓ Session management

### API Documentation

For detailed API specifications:

- **OpenAPI Spec**: See `openapi.yaml` for complete API documentation
- **Anchor/Admin/Shutdown Notes**: See `docs/ANCHOR_ADMIN_SHUTDOWN.md`
- **Interactive Docs**: Run `npm run docs` to view Swagger UI at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`
- **Postman Collection**: Import `postman_collection.json` for testing

**Quick API Reference:**

```bash
# Authentication
POST /api/auth/nonce          # Get nonce for signing
POST /api/auth/verify         # Verify signature and create session
POST /api/auth/logout         # End session

# Transactions
GET  /api/transactions        # List user transactions
GET  /api/transactions/:id    # Get transaction details

# Contracts
POST /api/contracts/split     # Initialize/update split configuration
POST /api/contracts/goals     # Create/manage savings goals
POST /api/contracts/bills     # Manage bill payments
POST /api/contracts/insurance # Manage insurance policies
POST /api/contracts/family    # Manage family wallet

# System
GET  /api/health              # Health check
POST /api/anchor/deposit      # Start anchor deposit flow
POST /api/anchor/withdraw     # Start anchor withdrawal flow
POST /api/admin/cache/clear   # Admin-only cache invalidation
GET  /api/admin/users         # Admin-only recent users
GET  /api/admin/audit         # Admin-only audit events
```

### Anchor deposit/withdraw flow notes

- `POST /api/anchor/deposit` body: `{ "amount": 100, "currency": "USD", "destination": "optional" }`
- `POST /api/anchor/withdraw` body: `{ "amount": 100, "currency": "USD", "destinationAccount": "optional" }`
- Routes call configured anchor interactive endpoints and return either `url` (interactive flow) and/or `steps`.
- Pending flows are stored in-memory so webhook callbacks can reconcile status updates.

### Admin route security

- All `/api/admin/*` routes require `ADMIN_SECRET`.
- Authorized inputs:
  - Header: `X-Admin-Key: <ADMIN_SECRET>`
  - Cookie: `admin_key=<ADMIN_SECRET>` (or `admin_secret=<ADMIN_SECRET>`)
- Rotate `ADMIN_SECRET` regularly; optionally restrict admin routes with an upstream IP allowlist.

### Graceful shutdown for in-process jobs

- In-process background work (nonce cache sweeper and webhook async handlers) now registers `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` handlers.
- On shutdown:
  - New background jobs are rejected.
  - Active jobs are awaited up to `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `15000` ms).
  - Process exits after hooks and timeout race complete.
- If production jobs run externally (Vercel Cron or a separate worker), this in-process shutdown path can remain idle.

## API Endpoints

### Pagination

All list endpoints support standardized cursor-based pagination with the following parameters:

- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of items to return (default: 20, max: 100)
- `cursor` (optional): Cursor for pagination (used to fetch the next page)

Response shape for all paginated endpoints:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "nextCursor"?: "string",
  "hasMore": boolean
}
```

### Available Endpoints

- `GET /api/goals`: Get paginated list of savings goals
- `POST /api/goals`: Create a new savings goal
- `GET /api/bills`: Get paginated list of bills
- `POST /api/bills`: Create a new bill
- `GET /api/remittance/history`: Get paginated list of transaction history

**API Versioning**

- **Approach (decided):** URL prefix versioning using `/api/v{n}/...` (e.g. `/api/v1/...`). This is simple to route, cache, and reason about in the frontend and server layers.
- **Current status:** The existing API surface in this repository is labeled as **v1**. To avoid breaking existing clients, the app rewrites `/api/*` to `/api/v1/*` at the Next.js layer so existing clients can continue using `/api/...` without changes.
- **Routes:** When adding new server routes, prefer placing them under `app/api/v1/` (or `pages/api/v1/` if using pages router) so they are clearly versioned. Optionally duplicate stable v1 routes under the `v1` namespace during a migration window rather than deleting the legacy route immediately.
- **How to introduce v2:** Create a new `app/api/v2/` namespace containing the new behavior. Update platform routes or API gateway rules to expose `/api/v2/...` and leave the rewrite in place so `/api/*` stays mapped to the last published stable version (v1) until you intentionally change it.

**Deprecation Policy**

- When a new major version (e.g. v2) is released, older major versions will be supported for a minimum of **6 months** before scheduled removal. During that window:
  - Maintain security fixes and critical bug fixes for the deprecated major version.
  - Announce deprecation clearly in changelogs and developer docs with migration guides.
  - Provide automated redirects or compatibility layers where feasible.

**OpenAPI / API Documentation**

- This repository contains an OpenAPI descriptor for the current v1 API at `openapi.yaml` (root). The `servers` entry points to the `/api/v1` base path. Update `openapi.yaml` as you add endpoints.

**Rate Limiting**

- All `/api/*` routes are protected by a global rate limiter using in-memory `lru-cache`.
- **Limits (per IP/session):**
  - **Auth endpoints (`/api/auth/*`)**: 10 requests per minute
  - **Write endpoints (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`)**: 50 requests per minute
  - **General read endpoints (`GET`)**: 100 requests per minute
- **Whitelisted routes**: `/api/health` is exempt from rate limiting to ensure uptime monitoring is not blocked.
- **Behavior**: When a limit is exceeded, the server responds with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code and a `Retry-After` header indicating the number of seconds until the rate limit resets. Rate limit information is also provided in the response headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`).

**Non-breaking guarantee**

- To meet the repository's backward-compatibility requirement, we keep `/api/*` behavior unchanged by rewriting it to `/api/v1/*`. This preserves compatibility for existing consumers.

If you want, I can also:

- Move or duplicate any existing API route files into an explicit `app/api/v1/` folder.
- Expand `openapi.yaml` with concrete endpoint definitions from your backend contract or tests.

API Endpoints (v1)

- `POST /api/bills` — Create bill transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Body: `{ name, amount, dueDate, recurring, frequencyDays }`
  - Validations: `amount > 0`, `dueDate` valid ISO date, when `recurring === true` then `frequencyDays > 0`.
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }` — unsigned transaction XDR ready for the frontend to sign and submit.

- `POST /api/bills/[id]/pay` — Build pay-bill transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }`

- `POST /api/bills/[id]/cancel` — Build cancel-bill transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Optional owner-only enforcement: set header `x-owner-only: 1` and `x-owner` to require the caller match the owner.
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }`

Notes:

- These endpoints return a transaction XDR composed of `manageData` operations that encode the requested action. The frontend should sign the returned XDR and submit it to Horizon (or via a backend submission endpoint) to complete the operation.
- Server builds transactions using the Horizon URL in `HORIZON_URL` and network passphrase in `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` (defaults to testnet). Set these environment variables in production to use a different network.

Insurance endpoints (v1)

- `POST /api/insurance` — Create policy transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Body: `{ name, coverageType, monthlyPremium, coverageAmount }`
  - Validations: `monthlyPremium > 0`, `coverageAmount > 0`, required `name` and `coverageType`.
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }` — unsigned transaction XDR ready for the frontend to sign and submit.

- `POST /api/insurance/[id]/pay` — Build pay-premium transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }`

- `POST /api/insurance/[id]/deactivate` — Build deactivate-policy transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Optional owner-only enforcement: set header `x-owner-only: 1` and `x-owner` to require the caller match the owner.
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }`

Notes:

- These endpoints return transaction XDRs composed with `manageData` operations to encode policy actions. If you prefer Soroban contract invocations, I can convert the builders to use contract calls.

## Stellar TOML discovery

RemitWise exposes wallet and anchor discovery support through the Stellar TOML standard (SEP-1).

- `GET /.well-known/stellar.toml`
- Optional redirect via `STELLAR_TOML_REDIRECT`

The endpoint returns a valid Stellar TOML file (complying with SEP-1 standards) with the required `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` CORS header and structured tables:

- **Global Fields**: `VERSION`, `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` (resolved dynamically to match active environment from `lib/contracts/network-resolution.ts`), and `SIGNING_KEY`.
- **Anchor & Server Endpoints**: `TRANSFER_SERVER`, `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`, and `KYC_SERVER`.
- **`[DOCUMENTATION]` Table**: Legal/org identification fields including `ORG_NAME`, `ORG_URL`, `ORG_DESCRIPTION`, and `DOCUMENTATION` (direct URL of the TOML).

To configure a custom domain, set environment variables in production or host a static TOML at the domain root. If the domain is not ready yet, use `STELLAR_TOML_REDIRECT` to point wallets to a hosted TOML.

Example environment variables:

- `STELLAR_TOML_REDIRECT`
- `STELLAR_SIGNING_KEY`
- `STELLAR_DOCUMENTATION_URL`
- `STELLAR_TRANSFER_SERVER`
- `STELLAR_WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`
- `STELLAR_KYC_SERVER`
- `STELLAR_ORG_NAME`
- `STELLAR_ORG_URL`
- `STELLAR_ORG_DESCRIPTION`
- `STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` (optional override)

## API Discovery

RemitWise exposes an OpenAPI discovery endpoint:

/api/.well-known/openapi

This allows integrators and wallets to automatically discover
the RemitWise API specification.

## Sentry

Sentry error monitoring is integrated for client, server, and edge runtimes.

**Required environment variables** (see `.env.example`):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` — public DSN for browser and client
- `SENTRY_DSN` — server/edge DSN (same value)
- `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT` — project identifiers for source map uploads
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` — CI-only token (never commit); store as secret in CI
- `SENTRY_RELEASE` — release id (git SHA or tag), set automatically in CI
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` — `development` | `staging` | `production`

**Sample rates**:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production` sets lower rates: `tracesSampleRate: 0.1`, `replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.05`
- Non-production uses higher rates for visibility

**Tunnel route**:

- All Sentry requests are proxied through `/monitoring` (configured in `next.config.js`) to avoid ad blockers.

**PII scrubbing**:

- Client (`scrubStellarPII`): Stellar addresses (`G[A-Z2-7]{55}`) and amounts (`\d+ XLM|USDC|USD`) are replaced before send.
- Server (`scrubServerPII`): same + `iron-session` tokens are redacted.
- Scrubbers live inside each config file for edge compatibility.

**Source maps**:

- Uploaded during build when `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` and CI are present.
- `hideSourceMaps: true` prevents browser exposure.

## Consistent Loading State Theme Customization

To enable downstream operators, contracts, and frontend engineers to style the loading state consistently, all skeletons expose custom CSS properties and semantic hooks:

- **CSS Variables**: Exposes `--skeleton-bg-start`, `--skeleton-bg-via`, and `--skeleton-bg-end` to customize the shimmer gradient colors.
- **Classes & Attributes**: Every skeleton renders with specific selector hooks (e.g. `.loading-skeleton` / `data-loading-state="skeleton"`).

For full details, selectors list, and examples, see the [Frontend Component States Guide](docs/component-states.md).

## SEO & Social Sharing Preview

RemitWise includes pre-configured Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata so that sharing the app link on platforms like Slack, Twitter, and Facebook renders a rich media preview.

**Configuration File**:
- Constants are maintained centrally in `lib/config/metadata.ts`.
- Edit `METADATA_CONFIG` to customize default title, description, application URL, and image specs.

**Metadata Fields**:
- `metadataBase` resolves relative image/page URLs to absolute paths.
- `openGraph` properties (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image`, `og:type`) are automatically rendered.
- `twitter` properties (`twitter:card` set to `summary_large_image`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`) are included.

**Assets**:
- The default preview image is served from `public/og-image.jpg`.
